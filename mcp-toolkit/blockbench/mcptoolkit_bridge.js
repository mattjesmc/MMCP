// MCP Toolkit: Bridge - the toolkit's own Blockbench plugin. BLOCKBENCH_BRIDGE_DESIGN.md is the record.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. The door between the toolkit's MCP shim (mcp-server/upstream/blockbench.mjs) and a
// running Blockbench: a small HTTP server on 127.0.0.1 speaking the same shape the GAME bridge
// speaks (GET /hello, GET /tools, GET /presence, POST /cmd), a queue so that calls from several sessions never
// interleave, a session -> project binding so that a call never lands in "whichever tab was
// active", and a tool surface designed the way the toolkit's own tools are: argument-checked by
// name, stamped with a mechanism, answering with the numbers the caller would otherwise spend a
// turn reading back, one undo entry per edit.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. An editor. Geometry, codecs, undo, the texture canvas and the viewport are
// Blockbench's, and this file only calls them (design section 2). The two older plugins beside
// this one (mcptoolkit_sync.js, mcptoolkit_entity.js) are unchanged and are reached through
// `risky_eval` exactly as before.
//
// HOW A PLUGIN GETS `http`. Blockbench 5's sandbox gates native modules behind a permission
// dialog and `http` is on no list at all; a plugin holding the `process` grant reaches it through
// `process.getBuiltinModule('http')` (Node 24 in Blockbench 5.1.6). The grant is asked for ONCE,
// and never with a modal this file opens by itself: the permission dialog is synchronous and
// freezes the renderer for every session using Blockbench until a human clicks, so `onload` asks
// with `show_permission_dialog:false` and, when refused, waits for Tools > MCP Toolkit Bridge >
// Start, where a human is by definition present. Files are read and written through
// `Blockbench.read` / `Blockbench.writeFile` (app code, no grant), so `fs` is never requested.
//
// ONE WINDOW PER SESSION (BLOCKBENCH_ISOLATION_DESIGN.md sections 6.3 and 10). Blockbench has one
// active tab per WINDOW and a second window is a fresh realm, so the window is the unit of
// ownership: each window's plugin scans upward from the base port for a free one and the port it
// wins IS that window's name; a shim scans the same range and asks each `GET /hello`.
//
// A WINDOW IS THE PERSON'S UNLESS IT WAS OPENED FOR AN AGENT. `POST /window` leaves the asker's id
// in shared storage and the next window to win a port consumes it, which makes that window
// agent-born and pre-claimed for whoever paid for it; only such a window can be claimed, so nobody
// has to remember to protect the one they are sitting at. (Measured 2026-09-08: relaunching the exe
// with the same --userData forwards to the running instance and adds no window, so only the in-app
// action makes one, which puts window creation in here.) Tools > MCP Toolkit Bridge > Let agents
// use this window is the deliberate exception, for handing yours over.
//
// AND AN AGENT-BORN WINDOW CLOSES ITSELF once nothing holds it and nothing is open in it - never
// the last one, which would quit the app. The per-project `held_by` refusal is untouched by all of
// this: the point of a window each is to stop NEEDING it.
//
// THE MCP DOCK (BLOCKBENCH_ISOLATION_DESIGN.md section 11, and the reason for 0.8.0). All of the
// above left every window to govern itself out of its own memory, and a live scan on 2026-09-10
// found what that costs: six windows serving, every one of them empty, not one with a death
// condition that could fire - three were never agent-born so their sweep never started, three were
// held by sessions that had not gone away, and nothing anywhere had a close route. So the window is
// the unit of OWNERSHIP but cannot also be the unit of GOVERNMENT.
//
// The dock is one window that outranks the rest: it owns the roster, hands windows out
// (`POST /dock/window` - reusing an empty one before making another), arbitrates every close, and is
// never claimed and never closes itself, which is what turns "never the last window" from three
// windows guessing at once into an invariant. It assigns each window its ROLE and can REASSIGN it,
// so a window stuck as somebody's own can be recycled instead of living forever.
//
// A plugin cannot see or touch a window: Blockbench's sandbox has no `electron` and no
// `@electron/remote`, so there is no window list, nothing to focus from outside, nothing to destroy.
// Every cross-window act here is therefore a request the target window serves FOR ITSELF -
// `POST /close`, `POST /focus`, `POST /role` - and a window whose bridge is stopped can be named and
// dated by the dock but only closed by a person. With no dock open, everything below falls back to
// exactly what 0.7.0 did.
//
// AN OWNED INSTANCE (HOST_DESIGN.md section 11 as built, 0.13.0). Under the daemon (mmcpd) none of
// the window government above applies, because there is no shared Blockbench to govern: the daemon
// launches `Blockbench.exe --userData <dir>` PER SESSION, a separate process with its own lock,
// settings and plugin registrations, and tells this plugin through the environment which port to
// bind (MCPTK_BLOCKBENCH_PORT) and whose it is (MCPTK_BLOCKBENCH_OWNER). In that mode the plugin
// binds exactly that port and no other, never looks for a dock, never beats, never sweeps itself
// away, and accepts a claim from the owner alone - the daemon started it and the daemon ends it.
// `GET /hello` says `owned: {owner, port}` so a shim (and the daemon) can tell.
//
// INSTALL: File > Plugins > Load Plugin from File; Tools > MCP Toolkit Bridge > Start; allow
// `process` ("Always allow for this plugin"). The shim finds it at http://127.0.0.1:25801.

    /**
     * WHAT A WINDOW WITH NO PROJECT CAN SHOW A PERSON - which until 0.10.0 was nothing at all, and
     * is why a person with eight bridge windows open had no way to tell them apart or close them
     * (BLOCKBENCH_ISOLATION_DESIGN.md section 12.1).
     *
     * MEASURED IN THE RUNNING APP, 2026-09-12, both ways in one call: with a project open the dock's
     * panel is 544x93 and connected; with none it is 0x0 and `#start_screen` is `display: block`
     * over the whole workspace. Blockbench hides the sidebars behind the start screen, so a PANEL is
     * invisible in exactly the state the dock is DESIGNED to sit in - no project, ever - and an
     * empty agent window sits in it too. The dock had been running and scanning for hours, with a
     * complete roster on `GET /dock`, and the person could not see one row of it.
     *
     * `addStartScreenSection(id, data)` is the surface that IS visible there: a global in Blockbench
     * 5.1.6 (`Object.assign(window, {StartScreen, addStartScreenSection})`), returning a handle with
     * `delete()`, inserting at the top of `#start_screen > content` by default. The spike that
     * settled it rendered 1000x211 with no project open, topmost and hit-testable by
     * `elementFromPoint`.
     *
     * TWO RULES HERE. The MODEL is separate from the painting and every button carries a function
     * rather than an id, so the whole of what a person is shown and can press is assertable
     * headlessly. And nothing that came off the wire goes in as markup: `addStartScreenSection`
     * passes its `text` through `pureMarked`, so it is given only static strings and every dynamic
     * value - window ids, session ids, client names, project names - is appended as `textContent`,
     * the same discipline the panels already keep.
