// MCP Toolkit: Entity — Blockbench plugin. ENTITY_AUTHORING_DESIGN.md §6 (phase 2).
//
// THE LOOP THIS CLOSES (§2), of which every arrow but the last two already existed:
//
//     author geometry + texture in Blockbench
//         -> ONE headless push (bbmodel -> interchange JSON + PNG -> mcptoolkitPush -> live pack)
//         -> stage_entity spawns a preview entity wearing it in the running game
//         -> the author (human, or agent via screenshot) judges the GAME'S OWN rendering
//         -> `verify` runs the mechanical checks plugin-side (overlap, coplanarity, UV)
//         -> promotion writes the same file into a consumer mod's resources
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT, and the rule behind it (§1, importing menagerie ROADMAP §45.2 rule 4,
// "one generator implementation, ever"): it CONVERTS FILE FORMATS. It never interprets geometry
// into meshes, never renders a preview of its own, and never decides what a model means. The one
// interpreter is `client/PreviewModels.java` in the game. What the author judges is the bake.
//
// It does compute two things from geometry, both sanctioned by §6.1/§6.2 and neither an
// interpretation: the model's BOUNDS (stage_entity needs a hitbox, and the server never parses
// geometry) and the VERIFY table (checks, not meaning).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CONVERSION, WHICH IS THE WHOLE JOB, AND WHERE ITS NUMBERS COME FROM
//
// The interchange format is VANILLA MODEL SPACE (§4.1): pivots and cube origins in entity-model
// pixels with y DOWN (a part posed at y=24 sits at the feet), part rotations in RADIANS, cube
// origins relative to their own part's pivot and pivots relative to their PARENT's pivot — because
// that is what `PartPose.offsetAndRotation` and `CubeListBuilder.addBox` take, and the loader does
// no arithmetic at all. So every trap lives here, once.
//
// The arbiter for the arithmetic is BLOCKBENCH'S OWN `modded_entity` CODEC, read out of the app
// (Blockbench 5.1.x, `Codecs.modded_entity.compile`, template "1.17"), because that codec's output
// is the thing modders paste into a mod and see come out right. Its rules, verbatim in effect:
//
//     bone pivot:  c = group.origin; if (group.parent is a Group) c -= parent.origin
//                  c[0] *= -1;  c[1] *= -1;  if (no parent) c[1] += 24
//     bone euler:  (rx, ry, rz) = (-deg2rad(r[0]), -deg2rad(r[1]), +deg2rad(r[2]))
//     cube box:    x = group.origin[0] - cube.to[0]
//                  y = group.origin[1] - cube.to[1]
//                  z = cube.from[2] - group.origin[2]
//                  (dx, dy, dz) = cube.to - cube.from     // always positive
//
// TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT ARE WORTH STATING BECAUSE THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SILENT KIND:
//
//  1. X IS NEGATED, NOT ONLY Y. The design points at menagerie's `CensusTool.bbmodel()` as the
//     trap checklist, and that function flips only y (`y' = 24 - y`, negating x and z rotation).
//     Both cannot be right, and the disagreement is not a bug in either: CensusTool exports to the
//     `free` format for eyeballing, while this exports to VANILLA, which vanilla itself renders
//     through `LivingEntityRenderer`'s `scale(-1, -1, 1)`. Two negations, not one. Following
//     CensusTool here would mirror every model left-for-right — invisible on the symmetric subjects
//     this workspace happens to be full of, and only visible on the first asymmetric one. The
//     codec wins; CensusTool stays the checklist for the ×16 scale trap and the y flip, which are
//     the two it documents best.
//
//  2. THE EULER ORDER NEEDS NO CONVERSION, and the reason is worth writing down because the
//     obvious reading says it does. Vanilla composes `Quaternionf.rotationZYX(zRot, yRot, xRot)`
//     (ModelPart.java:169) and Blockbench composes a THREE.Euler whose order is `Format.euler_order`
//     — which defaults to **ZYX** (`new Property(ModelFormat, 'enum', 'euler_order', {default: 'ZYX'})`).
//     Same order on both sides. And the flip (negate x, negate y) is diag(-1,-1,1) = a 180° turn
//     about Z, which is a PROPER rotation, so conjugating by it maps Rz(c)Ry(b)Rx(a) to
//     Rz(c)Ry(-b)Rx(-a) — order preserved, term by term. Hence "negate x and y, keep z" is exact
//     for three-axis rotations too, not just for the single-axis case everything here happens to
//     use. `mcptoolkit_entity.test.mjs` proves it by walking both spaces independently.
//
// Rotated CUBES are handled the way the codec handles them: vanilla has no per-cube rotation, so
// each rotated cube is lifted into a synthetic ROTATION SUBGROUP (`<cube>_r1`) sharing its pivot
// and angle, exactly as Blockbench does — same grouping rule, same insertion order.

//
// PROJECT AND GAME ARE WHAT `risky_eval` PUTS IN SCOPE (mcptoolkit_bridge.js), and both are
// deliberate (TODO.md 1.9). `project` takes the OBJECT, never a name: a name is resolved without
// the bridge's ownership check, which made this plugin one of the two routes into a project the
// session binding could not protect; omitted, the active project is used. `bridge` is REQUIRED for
// anything that touches the game and has NO default - this file used to carry a bare
// 'http://127.0.0.1:25599/cmd', and since per-project bridge ports (RELEASE_1.md B0) that port
// names the toolkit's own dev game, so from a consumer repo every stage went to the wrong game:
// refused if nothing was there, and accepted silently if the toolkit's own was up. Set one per
// project instead of passing it every time:
//     mcptoolkitEntity({action:'settings', set:{bridges:{'spider':'http://127.0.0.1:25642'}}})
//
// `push` sends nothing through the transcript: the bytes go Blockbench -> bridge directly, and what
// comes back is a summary plus the CLIENT's verdict on the geometry (`parse: "ok"`, or `"error"`
// with the reason), so a broken export never has to be guessed at from a screenshot.

    // THE SECOND HALF OF THE CONVERSION, AND IT IS THE SAME FLIP AS THE FIRST.
    //
    // The arbiter is the same one §7.1 found for geometry: Blockbench's own `modded_entity` codec,
    // read out of `app.asar`. Its `AnimationCodec('modded_entity').compileFile` pre-negates before
    // handing values to vanilla's `KeyframeAnimations` helpers:
    //
    //     position:  x *= -1              rotation:  x *= -1; y *= -1        scale:  unchanged
    //
    // Compose that with vanilla's own `posVec(x,y,z) = (x,-y,z)`, `degreeVec` (deg->rad, no sign
    // change) and `scaleVec(s) = s-1`, and the authored-to-vanilla rule falls out:
    //
    //     position  (x, y, z) px    ->  (-x, -y,  z) px
    //     rotation  (rx,ry,rz) deg  ->  (-rx,-ry, rz) rad
    //     scale     (sx,sy,sz)      ->  (sx-1, sy-1, sz-1)
    //
    // So position is THE SAME TWO-NEGATION FLIP as a part pivot, and rotation is the same rule as a
    // part's rest rotation. One coordinate convention across the whole format. The trap the design
    // flagged is real and is why this is written down: vanilla's `posVec` does half the flip and
    // Blockbench's exporter does the other half, so anything written from `KeyframeAnimations.java`
    // alone implements exactly half and mirrors every animation's x translation -- invisible on a
    // symmetric subject, which is most of this workspace.
    //
    // WHERE THE CONVERSION LIVES, which the design left open and §4.1 had already answered.
    // §9.1 proposed storing keyframes AS AUTHORED and letting the loader convert. This does not:
    // it emits the numbers `ModelPart::offsetPos/offsetRotation/offsetScale` finally receive, for
    // exactly the reason §4.1 gives for geometry -- "every trap lives here, once", and the loader
    // does no arithmetic at all. Storing authored values would have put HALF a flip (the half that
    // is not `KeyframeAnimations`') into the Java loader, where the harness next door cannot walk
    // it. One conversion, on the side that has an arbiter.
    //
    // PRE/POST RATHER THAN TWIN KEYFRAMES, which is the other thing §9.1 left open -- and the
    // arbiter settles it against the design's own lean. Blockbench's codec fakes a discontinuity
    // with a second keyframe at `t + 0.001`, and §1 ("converts file formats, never interprets")
    // reads at first like an argument for copying that. It is the opposite:
    //
    //   * Blockbench's document HAS the two-value concept natively -- `kf.data_points[1]`. Vanilla
    //     HAS it natively too -- `Keyframe(t, preTarget, postTarget, interp)`. Mapping dp[0]->pre
    //     and dp[1]->post is a field-for-field copy.
    //   * The twin keyframe is the codec working around ITS OWN TEMPLATE: the `mojang` text
    //     template only has `new Keyframe(%(time), vec, %(interpolation))`, the three-arg form. It
    //     cannot say `preTarget`. We are not writing Java text, so we do not inherit the limit.
    //   * Copying twins would INVENT the number 0.001, which appears nowhere in the document, and
    //     lose which keyframes were authored. That is the interpretation, not the tidy version.
    //   * And the semantics line up exactly. Blockbench's own interpolator reads
    //     `before.calc(axis, 1)` -> `other.calc(axis, 0)` (Keyframe.getLerp), i.e. leave on data
    //     point 1, arrive on data point 0. Vanilla's LINEAR reads `keyframes[prev].postTarget()`
    //     -> `keyframes[next].preTarget()`. Same rule, different spelling.
    //
    // STEP, which vanilla does not have, is exact under pre/post and only approximate under twins.
    // Blockbench holds a step keyframe's value until the next one (`before.interpolation == step`
    // -> `result = before`, checked BEFORE the catmullrom branch, so a step beats a smooth
    // neighbour). Writing the held value into the NEXT keyframe's `pre` and forcing that segment
    // LINEAR reproduces it exactly: vanilla lerps prev.post -> next.pre, both the held value, so
    // the segment is flat and the jump lands at the next keyframe. The codec's `next.t - 0.001`
    // twin instead ramps across the last millisecond. The one residue is a single instant: at
    // exactly the next keyframe's timestamp vanilla still reads `pre`, so it shows the held value
    // there rather than the new one. That is one point of a continuous function, against a whole
    // interval of ramp -- and it is recorded rather than hidden.
    //
    // TWO PLACES BLOCKBENCH'S PREVIEW AND THE GAME GENUINELY DISAGREE, both warned about rather
    // than silently "fixed", because the whole point of the loop is that the GAME is the judge:
    //
    //   1. Blockbench smooths a segment when EITHER end is catmullrom
    //      (`before.interpolation === catmullrom || after.interpolation === catmullrom`).
    //      Vanilla asks only the segment's LATER keyframe (`nextFrame.interpolation()`,
    //      KeyframeAnimation.Entry.apply). So a catmullrom->linear segment is smooth in the
    //      timeline and straight in the game. Blockbench's own codec has this mismatch too.
    //   2. On a looping clip Blockbench WRAPS the catmullrom control points around the seam
    //      (`before_plus = sorted.at(-2)`); vanilla CLAMPS them (`Math.max(0, prev-1)`). So the
    //      loop seam is smoother in the timeline than in the game.

    // §9.3 proposed posing these samples with Blockbench's own timeline evaluator, so that "no
    // second catmullrom exists". Reading both evaluators inverts the argument. The pose that
    // matters is the one THE GAME renders -- that is what an author judges, and what a collision
    // at a mid-clip pose would actually be a collision in. Measured against that, Blockbench's
    // evaluator IS the second implementation, and a demonstrably divergent one: it smooths a
    // segment when either end is catmullrom (vanilla asks only the later keyframe) and it wraps
    // catmullrom control points around a loop seam (vanilla clamps). Sampling through it would
    // check poses the game never takes.
    //
    // It would also be un-harnessable. `mcptoolkit_entity.test.mjs` exists because the exporter is
    // a PURE FUNCTION OF A DOCUMENT, testable with no Blockbench at all -- the discipline §7.3
    // went out of its way to protect with a travelling fixture. An arm that needs a live Blockbench
    // is an arm the harness cannot cover, and §7.2 already caught one of those pretending to be
    // covered (`pixelsOf()` had never run, because the harness injects the pixels it fetches).
    //
    // So this is vanilla's `KeyframeAnimation.Entry.apply` and `AnimationChannel.Interpolations`,
    // transcribed -- and the harness next door arbitrates it with a SECOND, independent transcript
    // rather than with a golden file, exactly as section 2 arbitrates the geometry flip.
